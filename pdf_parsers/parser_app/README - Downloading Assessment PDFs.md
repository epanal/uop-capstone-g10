---

### 3. **Download the PDF**
Once the PDF has finished generating:

- Click the **Downloads** button in the top-right of Kipu.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- The parser program identifies each patient using the **LO number** in the filename (e.g., `_LO-2024-005_`).
- This ID is **anonymized** into a `group_identifier` in the output CSVs and dashboard to protect patient confidentiality.
