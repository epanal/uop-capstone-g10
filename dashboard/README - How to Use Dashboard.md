## 🚀 Getting Started

  Primary Way:

  **Using the website**

  Alternate Way :
  
  **Start the Dashboard**
   - Run the main dashboard Python file:
     ```bash
     python app.py
     ```
   - This will launch the dashboard in your web browser (typically at `http://127.0.0.1:8050`).

### Dependencies
- All data used in the app.py file should be located in a single folder. The directory to that folder should be listed in a config.json file in the same directory as the app.py file. The instructions for obtaining new data files will be explained in the next section.
- The app.py file depends on many python libraries such as plotly.express and pandas. These can all be installed using pip.
- There are also custom python files we created for the app. All such files are in [this directory](https://github.com/epanal/uop-capstone-g10/tree/main/dashboard) and should be downloaded to the same directory as the app.py file.

## 📁 Data Requirements

This section outlines the data preparation steps required for the dashboard to run properly with the most up to date data.

### 1️⃣ Download Patient Assessments CSV Data from Kipu
Full tutorial for downloading the industry assessment CSVs is located here:[README - Downloading PDFs](https://github.com/epanal/uop-capstone-g10/blob/main/data_wrangling/README%20-%20Downloading%20Standardized%20Assessment%20Files.md)
- Log into the Kipu dashboard and export assessment-related data for:
  - WHO, GAD, PHQ, PTSD, DERS
- Run the assessment merge application to create CSV files for each of the industry standard assessment (contains all patients).
  
### 2️⃣ Download Patient Assessments PDF Data from Kipu 
Full tutorial for downloading the PDFs is located here: [README - Downloading PDFs](https://github.com/epanal/uop-capstone-g10/blob/main/pdf_parsers/parser_app/README%20-%20Downloading%20Assessment%20PDFs.md)
- Log into the Kipu dashboard and export assessment-related data for:
  - PHP Daily Assessments
  - Biopsychosocial Assessments
  - Substance History
  - AHCM Survey
- Navigate to the **Assessments** tab in the Kipu portal.
- Select a client and click **Generate the PDF Package** to compile a partial casefile.
- Once generated, go to the **Downloads** section (top-right) and save the PDF locally.
- These PDFs will later be parsed using the **Exist PDF Parser App**, which anonymizes patient IDs based on their LO numbers. Full tutorial for using the PDF parsing app is located here: [README - PDF Parser App](https://github.com/epanal/uop-capstone-g10/blob/main/pdf_parsers/parser_app/README%20-%20Parsing%20Assessment%20PDFs%20to%20CSVs.md))

### 3️⃣ Upload Prepared CSVs to pythonanywhere.com
