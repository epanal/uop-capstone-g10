## üöÄ Getting Started

  **Primary Way :**
  - Using the website (replace 'xxxxxxxx' with your site name):
    ```bash
    https://xxxxxxxx.pythonanywhere.com/
    ```

  **Alternate Way :**
   - Run the main dashboard Python file:
     ```bash
     python app.py
     ```
   - This will launch the dashboard in your web browser (typically at `http://127.0.0.1:8050`).

### Dependencies
- All data used in the app.py file should be located in a single folder. The directory to that folder should be listed in a config.json file in the same directory as the app.py file. The instructions for obtaining new data files will be explained in the next section.
- The app.py file depends on many python libraries such as plotly.express and pandas. These can all be installed using pip.
- There are also custom python files we created for the app. All such files are in [this directory](https://github.com/epanal/uop-capstone-g10/tree/main/dashboard) and should be downloaded to the same directory as the app.py file.

## üìÅ Data Requirements

This section outlines the data preparation steps required for the dashboard to run properly with the most up to date data.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Download Patient Standardized Assessments CSV Data from Kipu
Full tutorial for downloading the industry assessment CSVs is located here: [README - Downloading Standarized Assessment Files](https://github.com/epanal/uop-capstone-g10/blob/main/data_wrangling/README%20-%20Downloading%20Standardized%20Assessment%20Files.md)
- Log into the Kipu dashboard and export assessment-related data for:
  - WHO,  GAD,  PHQ,  PTSD,  DERS,  DERS2
- Run the **Assessment Merger App** to create merged CSV files for each of the industry standard assessment (contains all patients). Full tutorial for using the Assessment Merger app is located here: [README - Assessment Merger App](https://github.com/epanal/uop-capstone-g10/blob/58-edit-dashboard-readme/data_wrangling/README%20-%20Merging%20Assessment%20CSVs.md)
- Download the `clinical_data_report.csv` from Kipu (update the date range to include the desired time period prior to exporting).
- Run the **Statistical Dataset Builder App** to combine the merged asssessment data files and clinical data report. Full tutorial for using the Statistical Builder app is located here: [README - Statistical Dataset Builder App](https://github.com/epanal/uop-capstone-g10/blob/58-edit-dashboard-readme/data_wrangling/README%20-%20Building%20Statistical%20Dataset.md)
  
### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Download Patient Admissions Assessments PDF Data from Kipu 
Full tutorial for downloading the PDFs is located here: [README - Downloading PDFs](https://github.com/epanal/uop-capstone-g10/blob/main/pdf_parsers/parser_app/README%20-%20Downloading%20Assessment%20PDFs.md)
- Log into the Kipu dashboard and export assessment-related data for:
  - PHP Daily Assessments
  - Biopsychosocial Assessments
  - Substance History
  - AHCM Survey
- Navigate to the **Assessments** tab in the Kipu portal.
- Select a client and click **Generate the PDF Package** to compile a partial casefile.
- Once generated, go to the **Downloads** section (top-right) and save the PDF locally.
- These PDFs will later be parsed using the **Exist PDF Parser App**, which anonymizes patient IDs based on their LO numbers. Full tutorial for using the PDF parsing app is located here: [README - PDF Parser App](https://github.com/epanal/uop-capstone-g10/blob/main/pdf_parsers/parser_app/README%20-%20Parsing%20Assessment%20PDFs%20to%20CSVs.md)

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Upload Prepared CSVs to your PythonAnywhere website
- Upload the CSV files into your PythonAnywhere data folder under the Files. All of these CSV files should be present
```bash
- ahcm_survey_output.csv
- bps_anonimized.csv
- ders2_merged.csv
- ders_merged.csv
- extracted_php_assessments.csv
- gad_merged.csv
- patient_substance_history.csv
- phq_merged.csv
- ptsd_merged.csv
- stat_tests_data.csv
- who_merged.csv
```
